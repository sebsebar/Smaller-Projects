- [[new concept]]
    - This is a new concepts that states that the concept is X.
- **Textbook:** The **process** by which certain information is selected for further processing and other information is discarded. The **ability** to focus on a stimuli or location.
- Basically, it's a **spotlight**. It allows some #information in, discards others. It is affected by [[Bottom-up]], [[Top-down]] and [[cognitive control]].
    - Why? Because there's too much information in the world to be processed. Mind needs to optimize. 
    - There are two camps who try to describe attentional processes - early- and late-stage. Both occur some of the time and are dependant on the task ([[task-dependency]]) and stimuli.
    - One of the most accepted early-stage models(though not complete or final) of attention is **Treisman's Attentuation Model**
        - What differs it from previous early stage models is that it allow for **less** meaningfull information to pass but "weakens it".

She calls this process an attenuator. A process that analyzes incoming stimuli & **weakens** irrelevant stimuli.

A good example is words. Some meaningful words, in her theory, have a low [[threshold]], meaning they can be detected and processed even when the signal is **weak.**

- **What affects attention** - As said above, we discard one information in favor of other. Why do we attend to one things and not others?
    - [[Endogenous cues]] driven by high-level cognitive processes. [[Top-down]], goal-directed, intentional. 
        - Meaning and #knowledge factors. When you see an Estonian carplate with number 314 ZDA you attend more to it because, well, you know.
        - Task demands. If we are looking for a Netto we'll be more attentive to yellow signs and **less** attentive to other things.
    - [[Exogenous cues]] - driven by sensory stimuli, novelty, incindental, [[Bottom-up]].
        - Stimuli salience. Does the stimuli stand-out? This is a [[Bottom-up]] instance. If we see a big red elephant balloon on the street it will catch our attention. 
            - Relevant for [[perception]] - saliency map - scanning the environment and determening what **stands out** more or less
    - [[perceptual load]]
        - How many resources you are using aka how difficult the perceptual process is. Think when you open your fridge, looking for hummus but you have so much stuff that even though you know its there - it's hard to locate. This is an instance of [[Bottom-up]] selection models. A good instance of [[task-dependency]]. - so where both early and late-stage theories meet.
        - Btw, **perceptual capacity** is how much stimuli you can take in at a time. Like a cap.
    - [[cognitive control]]
        - The ability to influence your [[cognition]]. [[Top-down]]
        - [[cognitive load]] is similar to [[perceptual load]], only that it is more [[Top-down]] than bottom-up. It also refers to how many of your resources you are using, but the task at hand is a cognitive one, not perceptual.
            - {{[[TODO]]}} complete this with automated processing etc. Dynamics?
-   Attention is usually broken down into three different processes:
    - [[Selective attention]].
        - This is your focus. Focus on one thing, ignore others. The [[cognitive load]] capacity is majorly taken by this one information stream/task.
    - [[Divided attention]].
        - This is your regular state - you eat lunch while you speak with people while noticing that you have a pop-up on your phone etc. The [[cognitive load]] capacity is distributed across different information streams/tasks.
    - [[Attentional capture]]
        - This highlights the ability of the process to quickly shift "attention" towards a very salient stimuli - a loud noise, your name, a #memory that you forgot to turn off the kettle.
- Physiology of Attention:
    - [[Attention enhances neural responding]]
    - Attentional processing is distributed accross a large number of areas in the brain. [[distributed processing]]
- **Feature Integration Theory**
- As humans are very visual animals, the attention has been studied through vision. Types of visual attention:
    - Overt attention
        - Shifting attention corresponds to eye movements. Large or small(saccades). We always scan the environment and attend to things in our environment.
    - Covert attention
        - Shifting attention without corresponding eye movements. When I am typing this on the screen, I can see in my peripheral vision that the girl next to me is doing something odd with the laptop charging cord. This is covert attention. It's also very hard to study and it's often used to pay attention to **location**.
- Dynamics of attention. #project
    - [[Tools for Thought]] project - build interactive dynamic system tools for people to explore how cognition works. Similar to [[Nicky Case]] stuff.
    - [[Interactive Essay]]
- [[experiment]]s:
    - Gray and Wedderburn. Where they said Dear 7 Jane to one ear and 9 Aunt 6 to another ear. When the participants were asked to reply what they heard - they said "Dear Aunt Jane". Great showcase of #cogbias and **Attentuation Theory** with a "leaky-filter". Why #cogbias? Because it's uncoscious.
    - Donald MacKay. Where people listened to ambiguous sentences such as "They were throwing stones at the bank" with biasing words in presented to another ear - such as "money" "river", making people infer the meaning of the ambiguous sentence that was impacted by the biased words. 

They were given sentences such as

"They threw stones towards the side of the river"
"They threw stones at the savings and loan association yesterday".

But is it really different from the other experiment? #question [[Daina Crafa]]
- Other comments:
    - Think about attention from unconsciouss and consciouss perspectives.
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem
    - Autistic observers therefore create a mental representation of a situation that does not include much of the information that non-autistic observers usually use in interacting with others.
