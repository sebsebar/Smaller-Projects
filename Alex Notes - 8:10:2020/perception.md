- [[mind]] creates representations of the world for us to act within.
- [[perception]] is a link between those two things - creating representations and acting.
- The equation of perception:
    - Take in stimuli. Process it into [[neural code]] and send over to the brain.
    - The brain takes in that information, recognizes it with his previous knowledge + environmental and semantic regularities.
    - All of this soup is constantly boiled in [[Hemholtz's Theory]] and [[bayesian inference]] and voila - you've got perception.
- How does it do that?
    - Early phase - in which shapes and objects are extracted from the visual scene. Features, position, orientation, movement etc.
    - Later phase - in which the shapes and objects are recognized.
    - Illustrative example of those two cases is a disorder called Visual Agnosia. It's the inability to recognize visual objects, which is neither a function of general intellectual loss nor a loss of basic sensory abilities.
        - Apperceptive = cannot recognize shapes - deficit of early phase
        - Associative = cannot recognize complex objects - deficit of late phase?
    - In detail:
    - Light energy travels through the retine and **feature extraction** happens.
    - This forms a primal sketch of the visual field. **Depth information** is then perceived.
        - Texture gradient - elements tend to appear more closely packed together as the distance from the view increases
        - Stereopsis - the ability to perceive 3D because two eyes receive slightly different view of the world
        - Motion parallax - provides 3d information when an object is in motion. As more disant points move they will move more slowly across the retina than closer points
    - This forms a 2D sketch.
        - Identifies where various visual features are located relative to the viewer.
        - Represents only parts of surfaces and does not yet identify how these parts go together to form images of objects in the environment.
    - Gestalt principles of organizations are applied.
        - Tries to explain **perceptual organization** - the way elements([[feature detectors]]) are grouped together to form larger objects.
        - **Heuristics** utilizing [[Hemholtz's Theory]] to explain how objects are grouped together.
        - (a) Proximity
        - (b) Similarity
        - (c) Good continuation
        - (d) Closure

    - Bake all of this in [[Hemholtz's Theory]]. And voila, we got a 3D model.
        - Is it applied here or later? Or both?
    - No the visual world we "see" is organized into patterns that underlie different objects. We now have a 3D model of the visual scene. We must **identify and recognise** these elements now.
        - Here's were our long-term [[memory]] comes into place. We compare retinal information (of the features of the scene) to those in our memory (+ environmental and semantic context) via [[bayesian inference]] to recognize the object.
        - To optimize our computational capacity, we also chunk this process (sometimes) into **template model**
        - How does the process of going from features to objects work? Well, one theory is called **Recognition-by-components**
            - The object is segmented into a set of basic subobjects
            - The category of each subobject is classified (there are 36 basic categories called geons)

            - Having identified the subobjects out of which the object is composed and their configuration, one recognizes the object as the pattern (see [[neural code]]) composed from these pieces

        - In addition to that, semantic and environmental regularities are taken into consideration.
            - A tree is likely to be on the field, forest, beach. Unlikely in the living room - **environmental**
            - A cafe is likely to have comfortable chairs, people, a coffee machine, chatter etc - **semantic**
- Self notes:
    - These flow charts don't do the trick? Its way better to understand everything in the form of nodes in a neural network. Because its not a strict flowchart? Everything is impacted by everything.
