- [[attention]]
- [[4E Cognition]]
- Attention as a process of something that our brain is doing.
    - The process by which certain information is selected for further processing and other information is discarded
    - The ability to focus on specific stimuli and locations.
- Types of attentional processes
    - Selective attention
        - paying attention to one thing while ignoring others
    - Divided attention
        - Paying attention to more than one thing at a time
    - Attentional capture
        - Shift attention to very salient stimuli(loud noice)
        - Cocktail party phenomenon
- Types of **visual** attention
    - Humans are very visual animals - anki and connect somewhere
    - Overt attention
        - Shifting attention corresponds with eye movements
        - Visual scanning
            - Always overt attention
            - Movement of eyes from one situation to another. Saccade - small eye movements.
            - **Eye tracking** is a method that studies overt visual attention.
            - Causes:
                - Stimuli salience
                    - Does it standout? Based on physical properties. Bottom-up.
                - Meaning and knowledge factors
                - Task demands - is it relevant for my goals? (action?)
                - Can you generalize the causes for visual scanning to attention overall? For example thoughts you think etc?
            - #design [[Programming attention]]
    - Covert attention
        - Shifting attention without corresponding eye movements
        - Very hard to study. Commonly used to pay attention to location.
        - **Endogenous**
            - Driven by high-level cognitive processes. Top-down, goal-directed, intentional. 
        - **Exogenous**
            - Driven by sensory stimuli, novelty, incindental, bottom-up.
- There are limits(plural, so not hard-set one limit) to the amount of information in the world that the mind can attend to and process simultaneously.
    - There would be a huge computational load if we'd process everything silmuntaneously. What if we extended this load via BCIs? How would our #experience by like then? Connect with stuff from chapter one. [[The possibilities of BCIs]].
    - Good for survival, but not anymore. What other things can we look from this perspective?
    - [[exam]] #toresearch
    - Serial bottlenecks
        - A point in the path from perception to action at which people cannot process all the information in parallel

        - Both early and late are right. Another instance of soup of [[bayesian inference]]

Both models occur some of the time. It depends on task and type of stimuli.

They overlap.
            - Early models - broadbent's filter theory & treisman's attentuation model
                - **Very interesting:** the cocktail party effect doesn't necessarily have to be top-down, we can simply be condition to be familiar to the sound of our names. Be less biased about top-down, however important that is.
                - Salient words(see visual salience above - generic process?)
                - Information gets through, its just most of it is very weak, apart from what you pay attention to. They occupy a DEGREE of your attention.
                - [[Attenuation control]].
            - Late models - most of incoming stimuli is processed before attention occurs.
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Anki experiments to understand them better for this chapter. And others?
- Processing capacity - amount of information a person can handle
- Perceptual load - relative difficulty of the perceptual task
    - Low load-  easy to process
    - High load - harder to process
    - Harder task reduce attention to task-irrelevant stimuli
- Cognitive load
    - Different from perceptual load
- Cognitive control
    - The ability to control your cognitive functions (sometimes called "executive functions"), which include attention, memory and other cognitive processes
- To common ways we DO NOT attend to stimuli
    - Inattentional blindless
        - Not noticing something that is clearly there when paying attention to other stimuli
    - Change blindness
        - Not noticing changes to stimuli when paying attention to other stimuli. Movie errors for example - people wearing different accessoirs depending on frames.
- **The binding problem**. How are the sensations combined to create perception?
    - Treismann has a leading theory on this - Feature Integration Theory.

- Feature search vs conjuntion search as experiment method?
- Attentional bias towards emotional stimuli.
    - So, just [[bayesian inference]]?
- Loss of #information because not paying attention. Or is it #memory encoding thingy as well?
- Focused attention important in second stage - feature integration. But **not**  first stage?
- You dont have direct access to retinal information - important to internalize. Obvious, but important.
- {{[[TODO]]}} Investigate processing styles

- {{[[TODO]]}} Note down qs from Dainas class.
- {{[[TODO]]}} Ask a question to Daina - can we have a class in the end where we'd talk about all of the things WE DONT know about the brain - especially high level stuff. Maybe make a map like the video on physics(maybe I can help?)
